OA core is a Java library for automating software development.

The core of OA is the object model that is an object-relational, observable, reactive, functional, distributed object graph. 

This graph of objects and collections automatically work with persistence layers, frameworks, UI, reporting, microservices, security/permissions, and more.

This is a Model Driven approach for creating complex systems easily. 


### Key Concepts

*   observable objects and collections that scale - core for reactive object graphs (OAObject & Hub collection)
*   property paths - dot separated paths for interacting with object graphs, including filters, callbacks
*   remoting/distributed - allows scaling, failover, model synchronization across servers - where everything works like a single application.
*   datasource independent, ORM, RDBMS/JDBC, XML, JSON, yaml, REST, custom ... - any data, anywhere
*   desktop UI - automated rich components - UI and reporting
*   web UI - componentized web apps, reducing JS code almost completely.
*   metadata - object data, discovery, and includes business rules, security, callbacks, so that the model is the core.
*   reflective - techniques for automating interactions using object graphs, components and code.
*   functional - realtime filtering, merging, sorting, aggregating, object graph, visiting, joins, groupBy, more.


Full software systems can be visually designed and then automatically generated using the OA library, OABuilder visual modeling tool, along with the OA.G2 code generation
