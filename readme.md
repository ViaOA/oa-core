The core of OA is the object model that is an object-relational, observable, reactive, functional, distributed object graph. This graph of objects and collections automatically work with persistence layers, frameworks, UI, reporting, microservices, and more.

The Model Driven approach defines the entities, relationships, persistence, business logic, security, UI, endpoint access, work-flow and more.


## Key Concepts

*   observable objects and collections - core for reactive object graphs (OAObject & Hub collection)
*   property paths - dot separated paths for interacting with object graphs
*   remoting/distributed - allows scaling, failover, where everything works like a single application.
*   datasource independent, ORM, XML, JSON, yaml, REST, ... - any data, anywhere
*   desktop UI - automated rich components - rich UI and reporting
*   web UI - componenized web apps.
*   reflective - techniques for automating interactions using object graphs, components and code.
*   metadata - object data, discovery, and includes business rules, security, callbacks, so that the model is the core.
*   functional - realtime filtering, merging, object graph, visiting, joins, groups, more.

Full software systems can be visually designed and then automatically generated using the OA library, OABuilder visual modeling tool, along with the OA.G2 code generation
