The OA Platform is a model driven, reactive, observable, componentized, distributed, synchronized, dynamic, functional, secure, small foot print, high velocity system for building Applications.

The OA library offers solutions that use software patterns and techniques that allow for high reuse and functionality.

The focus is on _creating software that creates software_, where most of software development can be automated. This is accomplished by focusing on the computer science patterns within software development.

Using a model driven approach, where a model can be visually developed and defined. This allows a system to be organized in a way that gives high functionality, development velocity, and a reiterative constant improving software development process.

At the core of OA is the object model that is an object-relational, observable, reactive, functional, distributed object graph. This graph of objects and collections automatically work with persistence layers, frameworks, UI, reporting, microservices, and more.

The Model Driven approach defines the entities, relationships, persistence, business logic, security, UI, endpoint access, work-flow and more.

Full software systems can be visually designed and then automatically generated using the OA library, OABuilder visual modeling tool, along with the OA.G2 code generation


## Key Concepts for automation

*   observable objects and collections - core for reactive object graphs
*   property paths - dot separated paths for interacting with object graphs
*   remoting/distributed - allows scaling and failover, where everything works like a single application.
*   datasource independent, ORM, XML, JSON, yaml, REST, ... - any data, anywhere
*   desktop UI - automated rich components - rich UI and reporting
*   web UI - componenized web apps.
*   reflective - techniques for automating interactions using object graphs, components and code.
*   metadata - object data, discovery, and includes business rules, security, callbacks, so that the model is the core.
*   functional - realtime filtering, merging, object graph, visiting, joins, groups, more.
