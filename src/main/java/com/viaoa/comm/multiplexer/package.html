Multiplexer socket that allows multiple virtual sockets be used with one real socket.
<p>
Automates concurrent and parallel processing through a single real socket connection.

Works just like a socket and server socket, but allows them to share a real socket.
This is a good solution for load balancing solutions that work through firewalls, and proxies.
Includes solutions for throttling, "chunking"/fairness.
