Datasource independent access for storing and retrieving Objects from a persistent datasource.
<p>
Automates how objects and collections interacts with databases, datasources, and outside data.

<p>
An OADataSource is used to initialize, insert, update, delete and query Objects without using 
datasource/database specific commands or query languages.

<p>
Includes support for distributed DataSources.

<p>
A datasource is any form of service that provides persistent storage and retrieval of data.  The 
most common datasource is for databases that use SQL and have a JDBC driver.  Other types of storage 
could be NoSQL, flat files, XML, streaming to other systems, application servers, web services, legacy 
systems, object-relational engines, etc.

<p>
OADataSource subclasses self-register themselves with the static OADataSource.  This static OADataSource 
can then be used to find a OADataSource based on the Class of the Object that is being used.

<p>
Applications can be created that are independent of the datasource.  At any time, a new OADataSource can be
used without affecting the existing application or objects.  

<p>
<b>Queries/Selects</b><br>
The OADataSource Class offers the functionality to query a datasource based on the structure of 
the Object structure and not on the Datasource structure.  Results from a query are returned 
in Objects instead of data or resultsets

<p>
Queries are based on using a form of Object Query Language.  <i>Property Paths</i> are used to build "Where" and "Sort 
Order" clauses.

A <b>property path</b> is a dot (".") separated list of property names that are used to navigate 
from a root Class to a property value.  To go from object to object, reference property names are used.
    
<p>
<ul>
<li>All property names and connectors names are case insensitive.
<li>Can use the following connectors "AND", "&&", "||", "OR", "(", ")"
<li>Can use "=", "==", "!=", "<", "<=", ">", ">=", "LIKE", "%" (wildcard), "null" (any case)
<li>For convenience use OAConverter.toDataSourceString(value) to convert to String.
<li>For convenience use OAConverter.toDataSourceString(propertyName,value) to convert to a String that
will be expanded to be "propertyName =
<li>"ASC" ascending, "DESC" descending can be used with Order By properties.
</ul>

When retrieving/selecting Objects from datasource, if the retrieved object is for an OAObject that 
already exists in memory, the object in memory will be used instead of creating a duplicate object.

<p>
<i>OASelect query object</i><br>
The OASelect Class can be used for creating datasource independent Object Queries.  OASelect manages 
a query by working directly with a OADataSource.  The Hub Collection Class uses OASelect 
to perform its queries.<br>
Note: OASelect is a convenience object and is not required for querying an OADataSource 
(OADataSources can be used directly).

<p>
OADataSource has <i>Pass-through</i> methods, that can be used to run a native command on the datasource.
<p>
OADataSource can automatically create autonumber values for object identifier properties.  
A GUID (Global Identifier) can also be included so that the assigned value is unique across multiple
datasources.
<p>
OADataSources can use log files to report all changes made to datasource.

<b>Main Classes in this package</b>

<p>
<b>OADataSource</b> is an abstract Class that defines a datasource independent interface for
data storage and retrieval.  OADataSource manages all registered OADataSources.
<p>
<b>OASelect</b> works with OADataSource, used to build and manage datasource independent queries that 
return Objects.

<p>
<b>OAObject, Hub Collection and OADataSource</b>
<p>
The OADataSource interface was created to offer OA the ability to persist and query objects, eliminating all
of the code that is usually required to work with a datasource/database.  By establishing an
interface, the datasource is totally separated from the objects and application.  
A makes it very easy to replace an existing OADataSource with a new one.  For example, replace a
datasource that stored objects in a binary format (using object serialization), with a SQL Database.  Or, 
change database from one vendor to a different vendor.

<p>
OAObject automatically works with OADataSource for initializing new object, save(), delete(), 
getObject(), getHub(), and validating property Id changes.
<p>
OAObject calls OADataSource.getDataSource(Class) to receive the OADataSource that is registered to manage a 
particular its Class.  This OAObject then uses this DataSource to initialize, save, delete.<br>

<p>
Hub automatically works with OADataSources for select() queries, using the OASelect Class.
