/**
    A DetailHub is a Hub that automatically contains the object(s) of a property from the active object
    of another Hub (master).  This is referred as a <i>Master/Detail</i> relationship.
    <p>
    Whenever the active object of the master Hub is changed, the Detail Hub will automatically be updated
    to include the objects of a property in the active object.
    <p>
    Example:<br>
    A Department Class has many Employees (using a Hub).  A DetailHub can be created using a Hub of Department objects
    as the master Hub.  This DetailHub will automatically contain the Employee objects for whichever Department is
    currenly the active object in the master Hub.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="doc-files/Hub3.gif" alt="">
    <br>
    Using the diagram, the detail Hub is populated with the Employee objects from the Department that is the
    active object in the master Hub. Actually, the detail Hub is not really populated, but rather it uses
    the same Data that the Dept B Employee Hub is using. If an Employee object is added to the active Department's
    Employee Hub, the Detail Hub would also contain this Employee. 
    <p>
    In this example, a UI Component (ex: JTable) could be setup to list the Department objects and another UI Component
    (ex: JTable) could list the Employee objects from the Department that is selected. If another Department is
    selected, then the JTable listing the Employees will show that Departments Employee objects.
    <pre>
    * Hub hubDept = new Hub(Department.class);   // create new Hub for Department objects
    * hubDept.select();      // select all departments from datasource
    * Hub hubEmp = new HubDetail(hubDept, "Employees"); // create Hub that will automatically
    *                                                   //  contain the Employee objects
    *                                                   //  for the active Department
    * // Or
    * Hub hubEmp = new HubDetail(hubDept,"Employees", "lastName, firstName"); // sets sort order
    *
