/**
    Used to connect Hubs together based on a reference property.
    A Hub can be linked to a reference property of the active object
    in another Hub.

    <p>
    Types of linking:<br>
    1: link the active object in a Hub to a property in another Hub, where the property type is the
    same Class as the objects in this Hub.<br>
    2: link the <i>position</i> of the active object in a Hub to a property (numeric) in another Hub.<br>
    3: link a property in a Hub to a property in another Hub.<br>
    4: a link that will automatically create a new object in another Hub and set the link property,
    whenever the active object in a Hub is changed.

    <p>
    Examples:<br>
    <pre>
    * // Link department Hub to the department property in a Employee Hub
    * Hub hubDept = new Hub(Department.class);   // create new Hub for Department objects
    * hubDept.select();      // select all departments from datasource
    * Hub hubEmp = new Hub(Employee.class);
    * hubEmp.select();   // select all employees from datasource
    * new HubLink(hubDept, hubEmp, "Department");
    *
    * // Link the position of a value to a property in another Hub
    * Hub hub = new Hub(String.class);
    * hub.add("Yes");
    * hub.add("No");
    * hub.add("Maybe");
    * new HubLink(hub, true, hubEmployee, "retiredStatus");  // values will be set to 0,1, or 2
    *
    * // Link a the property value of active object to a property in the link Hub
    * Hub hub = new Hub(State.class);  // Class that stores information about all 50 states
    * hub.select();   // select all
    * new HubLink(hub, "stateName", hubEmp, "state");  // set the state property to name of state
    *
    * // automatically create an object and set link property when active object is changed
    * Hub hubItem = new Hub(Item.class);
    * Hub hubOrder = new Hub(Order.class);
    * Hub hubOrderItem = new HubDetail(hubOrder, "OrderItems");  // create detail Hub for
    *                                                            // order items
    * new HubLink(hubItem, hubOrderItem, "item", true);  // whenever hubItem's active object is
    *                                       // changed, a new OrderItem object will
    *                                       // be created with a reference to the
    *                                       // selected Item object.
    </pre>

    <p>
    Example:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="doc-files/Hub4.gif" alt="">
    <br>
    The Hub on the left is a collection of Employee objects. The Hub on the right has Department objects. <br>
    if the (A) active object is changed to "Emp 2", the (B) active object is changed to "Dept B",
    since that is the Dept for "Emp 2".<br>
    If the (C) active object is changed to "Dept C", the (D) Dept for the active object will be set to "Dept C".
    <p>
    This is a common setup when using ComboBoxes. In the above example, a form that displays an Employee would
    have a ComboBox that is a dropdown list of Departments to choose from. When the active object in the
    Employee Hub is changed, the Employees Department is retrieved and used to set the active object in
    the Department Hub - this will then display the correct Department in the ComboBox. When the user selects a
    different Department using the CombBox, the active object in the Department Hub is changed, which automatically
    changes the Department for the Employee.
    <pre>
    Hub hubDepartment = new Hub(Department.class);
    hubDepartment.select();
    Hub hubEmployee = new Hub(Employee.class);
    hubEmployee.select();
    HubLink hl = new HubLink(hubDepartment, hubEmployee, "Department");
    </pre>
    <p>
    Note: HubLink finalize (called during garbage collection) will remove a HubLink.
