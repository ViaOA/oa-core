/**
    Used for sharing the same objects that are in another Hub, with or without using the same active object.
    As changes are made to the objects, both/all Hubs will be notified.
    <p>    
    Shared Hubs are useful in GUI applications where the same collection of objects are needed for different purposes.
    <p>
    Example:<br>
    A JTable that uses a Hub of Department objects to display and maintain all of the Departments.
    A shared Hub could be created to use the same objects in a drop down list to select the Department for an 
    Employee. Both Hubs would be using the same objects, but for different purposes.
    <pre>
    Hub hubDepartment = new Hub(Department.class);
    hubDepartment.select();
    SharedHub hubDepartment2 = new SharedHub(hubDepartment);
    </pre>
    
    @since 2004/03/19 using methods built into Hub.  see {@link Hub#createSharedHub}
