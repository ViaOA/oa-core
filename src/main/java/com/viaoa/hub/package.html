Automates how object collections interact with other objects.
<p>
The Hub collection is used for containing a collection of objects.  The Hub is observable, meaning that it sends events
whenever a change is made.  Hubs can be configured to automatically work together to form powerful
relationships.

The hub package is made up of delegate classes that handle specific functionality and Hub subclasses that 
add automated features.
