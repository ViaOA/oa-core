    OALock is used for setting and sharing locks on Objects.  
    <p>
    Note: setting a lock does not restrict access to an Object, it only serves as 
    a flag.  It is currently the applications responsiblity to enforce rules based on 
    a lock being set.
    <p>
    Note: this also works with OASync (Clients/Server) to create distributed locks.
