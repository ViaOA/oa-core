<b>Object Automation (OA) by Via Object Architects (ViaOA, Inc.)</b>

<i>"All programs are made up of objects and collections of objects."</i>
<p>
OA automates how they work together.
</center>
<p>

At the core of OA is the object model that is an object-relational, observable, reactive, functional, distributed object graph.
This graph of objects and collections automatically work with persistence layers, frameworks, UI, reporting, microservices, and more.
Objects are kept in-sync across servers, so that a change on one computer is automatically changed on all other computers.
Since the objects are observable, systems can listen for specific changes and react.  Formulas can be recalculated, UI's updated, 
processing, filtered data updated, security enforced, etc.

<p>
The Model Driven approach defines the entities, relationships, persistence, business logic, security, UI, endpoint access, work-flow and more.
<p>
Full software systems can be visually designed and then automatically generated using the OA library, OABuilder visual modeling tool, along with code generation and templates.

<h2>Key Concepts for automation</h2>

<ul>
<li>observable objects and collections - core for allowing reactive object graphs
<li>property paths - dot separated paths for interacting with object graphs
<li>remoting/distributed - allows scaling and failover, where everything works like a single application.
<li>datasource independent, ORM, XML, JSON, yaml, REST, ... - any data, anywhere 
<li>desktop UI - automated rich components - rich UI and reporting
<li>web UI - componenized web apps.
<li>reflective - techniques for automating interactions using object graphs, components and code.
<li>metadata - object data, discovery, and includes business rules, security, callbacks, so that the model is the core.
<li>functional - realtime filtering, merging, object graph, visiting, joins, groups, more.
</ul>
